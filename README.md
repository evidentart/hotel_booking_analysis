# Hotel Booking Analysis Project

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is available at the following link:

- [Hotel Booking Dataset](<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/hotel-bookings-analysis?resource=download>)

## Key Features

- **Data Analysis & Cleaning**:
  - Processed over 119,000 records using **PostgreSQL** for initial data cleaning and transformation.
  - Utilized **WEKA** for further preprocessing, including handling missing values, feature selection, and transformations.

## Visualizations

The following visualizations were created to provide insights into various aspects of hotel bookings:

- **Scatter Plots**: Visualized relationships between features such as room prices and booking frequency.
- **Area Graphs**: Displayed trends over time, such as daily or monthly bookings, to help with demand forecasting.
- **Histograms**: Analyzed the distribution of numerical data, such as Average Daily Rate (ADR) or length of stay.
- **Bar Charts**: Showed comparison of bookings across different customer types or regions.
- **Cluster Maps**: Represented customer segments identified through K-Means Clustering.

## Data Preprocessing & Algorithms

The following algorithms were implemented and analyzed using **WEKA**:

- **K-Means Clustering**: Used to segment customers based on behavior and preferences, enabling targeted marketing and operational strategies.
- **Decision Trees (J48)**: Predicted booking outcomes, such as cancellations, and optimized room allocation strategies.
- **Linear Regression**: Applied to forecast demand and room pricing strategies based on historical data.

## Tools & Technologies

- **PostgreSQL**: Data cleaning and transformation.
- **WEKA**: Data preprocessing (e.g., missing values, feature selection) and running machine learning algorithms.
- **Python**: Data analysis and advanced modeling.
- **Tableau**: Interactive visualizations.

## Key Insights

- Identified high cancellation segments and seasonal booking trends.
- Optimized room allocation and pricing strategies based on clustering and regression analysis.
