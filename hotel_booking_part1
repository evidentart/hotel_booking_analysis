## Details of the Problem Our Proposed DSS Will Solve

The problem our proposed Decision Support System (DSS) will solve focuses on addressing inefficiencies in the hotel room booking process, which have led to lost revenue and customer dissatisfaction.  

Hotels often face challenges such as:
- Underutilized room inventory.
- Overbooking.
- Inconsistent pricing strategies.

These issues negatively impact the customer experience.  

Our DSS aims to:
- Use data to help hotel managers and staff make data-driven decisions on room pricing, occupancy forecasting, and booking management.
- Analyze historical booking patterns, customer behaviors, and pricing trends to optimize strategies.
- Enable real-time adjustments to pricing and inventory, improving room occupancy, preventing overbooking, and enhancing overall operational efficiency.

## Data Pre-Processing Performed

### Introduction
This section outlines the processes involved in data consolidation, cleaning, transformation, and reduction while working with hotel booking data. The primary tools used were:
- **PostgreSQL** for database management.
- **Tableau** for data visualization.

### Data Consolidation
1. Data was sourced from Kaggle and stored as a CSV file.
2. A PostgreSQL database was created to store the data.
3. A suitable table structure was designed in PostgreSQL, considering appropriate data types for each column.

### Data Cleaning
- Missing values were identified and addressed in columns such as:
  - `country`: 488 missing entries were replaced with "Not Specified."
  - `agent` and `company`: Similar cleaning methods were applied.
- Data types were reviewed and adjusted for compatibility:
  - `adr`: Set as a decimal type.
  - `is_canceled`: Treated as a boolean.

### Data Transformation and Reduction
- Normalized columns where necessary, focusing on `adr` (average daily rate).
- Used SQL queries to calculate normalized values and identify outliers in numerical columns (`adr`, `lead_time`).
- Filtered out irrelevant columns and applied sampling methods to streamline the dataset.

## Analysis and Insights

### Key Analyses Conducted
1. **Booking Trends:** Identified seasonal booking patterns and peak periods over time.
2. **Guest Demography:** Examined guest characteristics, such as nationality and repeat visits, to understand the customer base.
3. **Occupancy by Hotel Type:** Assessed occupancy rates for city and resort hotels to optimize room availability and pricing.
4. **Revenue Analysis:** Analyzed revenue trends, including ADR (average daily rate), to uncover opportunities for revenue maximization.

## Preliminary Business Analysis

### Descriptive Analytics
This phase focuses on understanding the current trends and customer behaviors, such as:
- Reservations and cancellations over specific periods.
- Trends in booking times (e.g., holidays).
- Cancellation patterns.

### Prescriptive Analytics
This phase provides actionable recommendations to:
- Optimize pricing strategies.
- Reduce cancellations.
- Recommend operational adjustments like staffing and inventory.

The implementation of prescriptive analytics will enhance customer satisfaction, save costs, and increase efficiency.

## Conclusion
The proposed DSS provides actionable insights to address inefficiencies in the hotel booking process, ensuring better utilization of resources, reduced cancellations, and enhanced customer satisfaction.
